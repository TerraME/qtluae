  QtLua-Extras Build Instructions
  ===============================


The build/cmake folder contains a CMake project for building QtLua-Extras.
Until now its build has been tested only on Linux Ubuntu 12.04.

Future releases will be tested on Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows
and others Linux flavours.

You should use at least CMake version 2.8.7 for building QtLua-Extras.
Older versions than this may not work properly.

Make sure you have all the third-party library dependencies
listed in the DEPENDENCIES file on the root of the codebase.

Follow the build steps below according to your platform.

1. Build instructions on Linux with g++ (GNU gcc)
-------------------------------------------------

1.1. Open a Command Prompt (Shell).

1.2. We will assume that the codebase (all the source tree) is located at:
/home/user/qtlua-extras/codebase

1.3. Create a folder out of the source tree, for example:
$ cd /home/user/qtlua-extras
$ mkdir build-linux
$ cd build-linux

1.4. For Linux systems you must choose the build configuration:
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="/usr/local" -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH="/usr/local/include" -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH="/usr/local/lib" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-std=c++0x" ../codebase/build/cmake

Notes:

       a) For GNU gcc releases newer than 4.7 the -std=c++0x option in the above command must be replaced by -std=c++11

       b) For building with Qt5 you can provide the Qt5_DIR variable as:
          -DQt5_DIR:PATH="/usr/local/lib/cmake/Qt5"

1.5 Building:
$ make

1.6 Installing:
$ make install
